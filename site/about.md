# About

The gE.CO toolbox is a platform for empowering commons organisations accross Europe.
Commons organisations are formal groups or informal communities of citizens
who manage fab-lab, hubs, incubators, co-creation spaces or social centres created in regenerated urban voids.

The toolbox is part of an EU Horizons 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 822766).

The aim of the toolbox is to deploy [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
software for commons organisation to help them in the management and organisation of their spaces.

## The platform

The toolbox is made up of two parts.
The first is a system for requesting a geco deployment,
it guides you through making your request and constructing your deployment.
We then have a review process to decide which deployments get the green light
and then we can start up servers to deploy the software.

We also provide [rich documentation](https://docs.gecotoolbox.io) for deployments and the platform as a whole.
We want to be as open as possible, so we don't hide anything.
The documentation for using the platform is alongside our documentation for administering it.

## Deployments

The second part of the system is the deployments themselves.
We think the most important tools to deploy would be those that

- Help make decisions
- Publish information
- Share files

So we chose [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/),
[NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
and [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) as the tools we deploy.
We feel these cover those goals well, even if there is a bit of overlap between the tools.

To brings the tools together we also provide a common dashboard to quickly navigate between the services in a deployment.
And we also add a custom button inside each service to quickly jump back home.

## Who are we?

We are [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk), a world leading Ubiquitous Computing and HCI research group based at Newcastle University.
