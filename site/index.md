We're building a platform to empower commons organisations.

Say you run a group that has taken over an abandoned space,
or teaching ad-hoc classes in an unused classroom.
Maybe you're having trouble scaling your efforts, or getting your message out.
We're here to help you.

We've put together a stack of technologies to help these kinds of groups
in their daily management and organisations.

The gE.CO toolbox is part of the EU horizons 2020 programme
and is developed by [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk).
