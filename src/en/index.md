## Welcome to the gE.CO toolbox

The gE.CO toolbox is a collection of software services that allow communities to take advantage of free to use technologies.
These technologies are usually difficult to setup. With the toolbox, we’ll handle the technical side, allowing you to get on with what’s important to you.

The toolbox is designed to be used by organisations in the commons.
All of the software has been designed to help organisations carry out the tasks they currently struggle with.

The gE.CO toolbox is part of the EU horizons 2020 programme
and is developed by [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk).
